## NE470 Group1 Project 2
Project 2:  Calculating Critical Width for given slab reactor composition.

In this folder you will find the code (.f08 file), executable, a config
file, a flowchart, and a directory of screenshots that have captured actual 
output.

To run this quickly, use the following command, which pipes config file
into the script for you:

cat fortran_config.txt | ./ne470_project2_5.exe

Each line in the config file corresponds to a user input in the .f08 file
