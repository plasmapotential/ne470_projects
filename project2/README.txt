## NE470 Group1 Project 2
Project 2:  Calculating Critical Width for given slab reactor composition.

In this folder you will find the code (.f08 file), executable, a config
file, a flowchart, and a directory of screenshots that have captured actual 
output.

Examples of different mesh node sizes and widths are in the screenshots
folder.  This program can handle an arbitrary number of nodes, and an
arbitrary initial width guess.
