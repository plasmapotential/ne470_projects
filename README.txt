Each project is stored in a directory in this repository.  Navigate to the desired
project and find the README in each directory.

In general, these projects are steps towards developing numerical methods to solve
neutron diffusion equations, reactor criticality calculations, and more, in Fortran.

Each project can be compiled after cloning.  A bash terminal is required for some
of the .sh files.
