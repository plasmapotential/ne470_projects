## Welcome to the Github Repo For NE470 Group 1 Projects

# University of Tennessee - Knoxville, Department of Nuclear Engineering

Each project is stored in a directory in this repository.  Navigate to the desired
project and find the README in each directory.  Instructions for running the programs
on a local machine are in the README.  Additionally, some sample plots that were created
utilizing the models are in the "plots" folder in each project, where applicable.

In general, these projects are steps towards developing numerical methods to solve
neutron diffusion equations, reactor criticality calculations, and more, in Fortran.

Each project can be compiled after cloning.  A bash terminal is required for some
of the .sh files.
